    <h2>Q-10 Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h2>
    <p>-->There are two reasons behind this:
        <ol>
            <li>It enhance the legibility of styles sheets.The background property in css, and if it is combined with color,the complexity will further icrease.</li>
            <li>Color is an inherited property while the background is not. so this can make confusion further</li>
        </ol>
